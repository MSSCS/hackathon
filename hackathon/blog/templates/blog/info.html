          <h2><a class="article-title">GitHub Student Developer Pack</a></h2>
          <img src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4b0317bc-4599-11e4-8bc3-0ca4dd5223e8.png?fit=2284%2C889" style="max-width: 100%;">
          <p style="margin-bottom: 4%;"class="article-content">GitHub currently offers a service for high school and university students called the GitHub Education Pack. With it you are given access to tons of expensive software for free, such as Unity Pro and Bootstrap Studio. </p> 
          <p>You can also use it to get free hosting through DigitalOcean or to get a free domain which is perfect if you're making a website for your submission. 
            To get the GitHub Education Pack you have to prove you are a student by filling out a form with GitHub and sending a picture of your student or report card. 
            For me the verification process took ~5 minutes but this may differ.</p>
